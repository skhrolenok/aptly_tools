## Agenda

Building a robust B2B (Business-to-Business) application for delegation of authority and decision management requires careful selection of tools and services that handle Customer Identity and Access Management (IAM), user management, feature flagging, and other critical functionalities. 

In this comparison, we'll evaluate a set of proprietary tools—**Frontegg**, **WorkOS**, **Descope**, **BoxyHQ**—alongside cloud services like **Microsoft Entra B2B** and open-source solutions such as **Keycloak**. This analysis will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each option, enabling informed decision-making for your B2B app development.

- **Enterprise-Specific Features**:
  - **WorkOS** is optimal for applications targeting enterprise customers needing features like SSO, directory sync, and enterprise security compliance.

---

## 4. Recommendations

### **Feature Flagging and Permissions Management**

- **BoxyHQ** stands out for feature flagging and permissions management. It can be integrated with various IAM solutions to control feature access dynamically.

- **Frontegg** excels in customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions, its native support for Feature Flagging is limited compared to dedicated tools like LaunchDarkly or BoxyHQ.

- **Descope** is more focused on passwordless authentication and identity management rather than feature flagging. Since Descope lacks robust feature flagging support, it's best to integrate it with a tool like FeatureFlag or Optimizely.
